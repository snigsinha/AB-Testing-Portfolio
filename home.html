        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          For my UI/UX class at Brown, I learned about A/B testing and how it's used to make incremental design decisions to optimise
          for an ideal outcome. For this assignment, we were asked to make two versions of the same cacti e-commerce browsing page 
          with one small design difference. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The A/B experiment I conducted and findings are covered in the infographic below
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The experiment found that <strong>neither interface A nor lead to shorter time to completion or higher return rate</strong>.
          This finding is limited by the small sample size of 12 users. Many of the users were also known to be classmates
          who were using the site as a way to inflate sample size. Instead, users for testing should ideally be using the site
          with the intention of potentially buying the cacti.
        </p>
        <p>
        Overall, further testing needed to validate results. In further tests, having a larger sample size that includes
          a variety of users will be essential to producing accurate results with valuable findings.
